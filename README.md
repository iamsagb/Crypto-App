# CryptoApp - SwiftUI

CryptoApp is a cryptocurrency tracking app developed using SwiftUI. It allows users to keep an eye on various cryptocurrencies, curate a watchlist of their favorite coins, and receive live price change updates. This app has been created to showcase my skills in iOS app development and SwiftUI, and it serves as a valuable addition to my GitHub portfolio.

Features
Coin List: Browse through a diverse range of cryptocurrencies with real-time price updates. The app provides key information such as current price, market cap, and price changes.

Watchlist: Users can personalize their experience by adding coins to their watchlist. This makes it convenient to track the performance of selected coins in a centralized manner.

Live Price Changes: Get instant updates on price changes for both individual coins and those on your watchlist. The app provides percentage change information over various timeframes (1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days) for quick analysis.

User-Friendly Interface: The app is designed with a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and access essential cryptocurrency data.

Technologies Used
SwiftUI: The entire app is built using SwiftUI, Apple's modern framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.

Combine Framework: Combine is used for handling asynchronous and event-driven code, enabling the app to efficiently manage data flow and updates.

Networking: The app employs networking libraries to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data from reputable APIs.

Open the project in Xcode.

Build and run the app on the iOS simulator or a physical device running iOS 15.0 or later.
